	<p1>
		Grove St Gallery is a small independent art gallery located in the centre of Edinburgh. Opened in 2008 in a renovated Victorian tenement house, we pride ourselves in displaying artwork produced by local artists in the Lothian area. Derelict for 20 years the old building now has a unique ascetic, achieved through the marriage of traditional Victorian era interior design and fascinating artwork from some of Scotlandâ€™s finest artists.
